# Board of Directors Project

You work for a research firm that specializes in corporate governance. Your team has been hired by a group of institutional investors who are interested in identifying the key
attributes of successful boards of directors. They believe that a more diverse and experienced board of directors can lead to better decision-making, improved performance, and increased accountability.

The investors have provided you with two data sets. The first data set contains information about companies and their respective industry, such as the company name and sector. 
The second data set contains information about board of directors and their associated companies, such as the director's name, the company they serve on the board of, and their experience/diversity.

Your task is to join these two data sets together and analyze the data to answer the following questions:

Questions:
1. Which Industry has the largest number of Board of Director members? (if one board member sits on the board of multiple companies within the same industry,
   those would each count as a separate instance of that industry)

2. Which Company has the largest number of Board of Director members? How many diverse board members does this company have?

3. What is the total experience of non-diverse and diverse board members in the banking industry, in terms of combined years? (this requires two answers: years
    of experience of diverse members and years of experience of non-diverse members)

Answering these questions will help the investors to identify which industries and companies have the most experienced and diverse boards, and which may need improvement.
This information will be used to inform their investment decisions and to engage with companies to improve their governance practices.

Guidelines:
-	Any industry that is Null should be updated to say “Banking”
-	You will need to use a new tool we haven't covered to prep the "Individual Names and Company" file before joining it to the "Company Name and Industry" data.
   If you want a hint, I have provided a hint box you can expand next to the "Answers" (Hints #1 & 2 relate to this new tool)
- As a tip; remember to check the right and left output anchors of the join tool in case you need to make changes to the data. Again,
-  if you want a hint, refer to the hint box (Hint #3 is related to this).
