# Charity Pledge Report

Your manager has asked you to connect the pledge report to a master data set of charity information so that you can better understand which charities are receiving
the most support and which methods of giving are being used the most. By completing this problem set, you will be able to help your manager gain valuable insights
into the organization's charitable giving and make more informed decisions about how to allocate resources in the future.


## Guidelines:
-	Cleanse and prep the two data sources.
-	Summarize the data as you fit to answer the below questions from your manager.

## Questions:
1. Which charity category had the largest total pledge amount?

2. Which charity received the highest number of credit card individual donations (not highest dollar amount)?

3. Which charity had the highest total pledge amount in the state of New York (employee state) for the 'Public' charity category?
